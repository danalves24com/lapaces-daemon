**A free and open-source computational inteligence**
## What is it?
LADA is at it's core a Java library, which has been implemented into the following:
- **[LADAos](https://github.com/danalves24com/LADEos)**
- **[LADAshell](./source/LADE-shell)**

## Why?
Wheather you are a software developer or a regular user, LADA can make your life easier. LADA is filled with many algorithms for tasks which would otherwise take longer or simply be tedious.

## I NEED YOU ðŸ‘‰
Have you made an algorithm you are really proud of? Do you have a neat library going? Please Share! We are trying to compile the best algorithms out there, to create the best OS computational inteligence possible. You will ofcourse recieve the proper credit.
